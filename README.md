# Reodering-LST-Dataset
I extracted some remote sensing a Land Surface Temperature (LST) data using Google Earth Engine. The LST data  were extracted from 13 stations. The aim of the code was to reorder the columns such that the dates will be in the first column and the 13 stations will be after the first colums in the first row.
